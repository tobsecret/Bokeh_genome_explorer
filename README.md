# Bokeh_genome_explorer
This is my first Bokeh server app.

Here is what it does:
1. loads up a fasta file with coding sequences (DNA) 
2. calculates the z-score-normalized codon distribution in all coding sequences
3. applies PCA to the dataframe with the codon distributions
4. plots a scatter plot of the PCA data
5. serves the codon distribution of a single selected data point in form of a bar diagram
